Summary

Ever since I was young I have always loved to build and engineer. It all started with legos and Radio Shack electronic kits. After high school, I joined the Army as a Signal Support System Specialist and was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division. Not only could I play with radios but I got to jump out of airplanes too. It was during this time that I picked up basic computer and networking skills. Once I got out of the Army, I wanted to move out West and become a smokejumper. As life happens that dream faded, but I was still tinkering with electronics and would soon gravitate towards Linux. At this point I decided to use my G.I. Bill for college and got a programming degree so I could understand the programs behind Linux OS. During my studies I discovered Gentoo Linux, which sent me down a rabbit hole, from compiling my own kernel from scratch to configuring my own desktop. It was like my electronic kits as a kid. Every little nuance was at my fingertips. Compiling everything from scratch. I explored every part of the kernel I could. I even went out and got my amateur radio license to work on parts of the kernel I hadn’t used yet. Later I would go on to build my own software defined radios.

I was still intrigued by the West, so I applied for a MySQL Database Engineer job at RightNow Technologies in Bozeman MT. I knew just enough about MySQL to get me in trouble. I continued learning as I settled into my space as a DBA. Analyzing queries, restoring, and tuning databases. After RightNow was acquired by Oracle, I continued working within the company for 7 additional years with a really amazing team. Eventually, the DevOps world called out to me and I took a job at another startup company, where I began working in my New Gentoo, AWS. I love having the ability to write and build whole datacenter at the push of a button.
 
My specialties include quickly learning new skills, programming languages, and problem solving. I'm still enthusiastically learning new platforms, frameworks, building pipelines, and programming languages. Feel free to reach out to me to see where I can fit into your team.
